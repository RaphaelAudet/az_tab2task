[DEPRECATED]

# Introduction

I am hooked to Pocket chromium extension and I use it for everything, to send stuff to read later, to watch later, to buy later, to DO later...And it's getting crowded!

It's usually better to do thing right away, but multitasking is bad! Therefore a button to add the page to your favorite Task tool.
